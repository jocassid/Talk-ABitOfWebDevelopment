## Building this project

## Notes

### html5intro.html

- The HTML5 has been around for a number of years and has good support across 
modern browsers.
- Adds a number of features that developers may have not encountered.

### pageStructure.html

- Modern web pages tend to use a ton of <div></div> elements.  HTML5 
introduced a number of elements for which divs have typically been used.

### figures.html

- The figure element was added to provide an easy way of creating an image with a caption

### newInputTypes.html

- HTML5 introduced several new input types.  These types provided some 
automatic validations
- Data received from client still needs to be validated on server-side to make
sure that the users don't do anything nefarious.

### inputWithDataList

- text input with autocomplete
- No validation, lets you input values not in data list

### patternValidation.html

- Validates text against regular expression with no JavaScript required
- Note: gives you a "Doesn't match pattern error".  It's up to you to explain 
what the patterns is.

### canvas.html

- A box that you can programmatically draw to.
- Show page source
- Note: If you need to output a custom graphic, you may want to consider 
generating an SVG on the server.

### css.html


### cssKeepItRelative.html

- Not all screens are the same size, windows can be resized, and text size can be 
changed (CTRL + plus/minus).  It's better to use relative units

### cssVariables.html

- CSS variables help maintain consistency across style rules.
- Are especially useful for defining a color palette

### sassPerhaps.html

- A stylesheet language that compiles into CSS
- Certain front-end frameworks (i.e. Angular 2+) give you the option of using 
SASS when setting up your project
- Allows for nested rule definitions, variables
- This is the first place in this presentation where you might need to use npm 
or some other tool to manage JavaScript packages.
