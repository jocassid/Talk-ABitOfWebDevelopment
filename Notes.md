# Notes

## forms1.html

- HTML5 introduced several new input types.  These types provided some 
automatic validations
- Data received from client still needs to be validated on server-side to make
sure that the users don't do anything nefarious.


## css.html


## cssKeepItRelative.html

- Not all screens are the same size and windows can be resized.  It's better 
to use relative units
